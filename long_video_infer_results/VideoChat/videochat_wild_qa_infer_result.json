    "pred": "Plowing is an important agricultural activity that helps to prepare the soil for planting crops. A chisel plow is a type of plow that is used to break up the soil and create furrows for planting. It is typically used in fields with heavy clay or rocky soil that is difficult to till. By using a chisel plow, farmers can create a more even and consistent soil structure that is better suited for planting crops. Additionally, chisel plows can be used to create a shallow furrow that helps to conserve moisture and reduce erosion. Overall, chisel plows are an important tool for farmers to use in their agricultural operations."

    "question_type": [
      "Spatial relationship"
    ],
    "pred": "Yes, 40 gallons of fuel is enough to make an entire round on the field. However, the amount of fuel needed to make a round on the field will depend on the size of the field, the type of equipment being used, and the efficiency of the equipment.\n\nFor example, if the field is large and the equipment is a tractor with a large engine, then 40 gallons of fuel may not be enough to make a full round. On the other hand, if the field is small and the equipment is a small tractor with a smaller engine, then 40 gallons of fuel may be sufficient to make a full round.\n\nIt's important to note that fuel efficiency can vary depending on the type of equipment being used, the terrain of the field, and the weather conditions. It's always a good idea to check the fuel capacity of the equipment and plan accordingly to ensure that there is enough fuel to make a full round on the field."
