This reduces the need for herbicides and other weed control methods. Additionally, straight-cutting canola can also help to improve soil health by leaving the crop residue on the field, which acts as a natural fertilizer and helps to retain moisture.

Additionally, the snow can also provide moisture to the plants, as it can melt and provide water to the soil.

By hiring contractors, the farmer can tap into their knowledge and skills to ensure that the farm is running smoothly and efficiently.\n\nAnother reason could be that the farmer wants to focus on specific areas of the farm that require specialized expertise. For example, if the farmer wants to improve the quality of their livestock or crops, they may hire contractors who specialize in those areas. This allows the farmer to focus on their core strengths while outsourcing tasks that require additional expertise.\n\nAdditionally, the farmer may choose to use contractors to save time and labor. By hiring contractors, the farmer can delegate tasks that are time-consuming or require a lot of physical effort. This allows the farmer to focus on other aspects of the farm, such as marketing or financial management, while the contractors handle the more labor-intensive tasks.\n\nOverall, using contractors on the farm can provide the farmer with access to specialized knowledge, skills, and resources, allowing them to improve the overall efficiency and productivity of their farm."
